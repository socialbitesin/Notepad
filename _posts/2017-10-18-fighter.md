__________________________________________________________________
When people start doubting _You_,  
Your _Caliber_  
Your _Determination_
Your _Devotion_ 
Your _Idea_ 

When they try to tear apart every bit of of your _confidence_.  
When they make You  feel low evey moment every second of _your life_.  
When they treat you as _useless_  

_Don't feel bad.  
Don't reply them by mouth.

Don't let their opinion become your reality.  
Don't let their thought even once seep through you._  

_Let your success slap them    
Let Your Success send them an unequivocal message  
That what you are capable of._

**Your Success will compel them to sing the song Of your Glory.**
